# ACDA-Pytorch

This repository is for the pytorch implementation of our ICCV 2021 paper Adaptive Convolutions with Per-pixel Dynamic Filter Atom


For details please refer to [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07895.pdf).

We will update the network configurations, training scripts, and pretrained weights later. 

## Usage

Modify config.py for the path to the bessel.npy file first before running any experiments.
